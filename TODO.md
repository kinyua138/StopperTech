# Website Animation Optimization Plan

## Objective
Optimize hover animations to reduce lag and improve loading performance while maintaining visual appeal.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Optimize Main Navigation (main.css)
- [x] Simplify nav link hover effects (remove complex transforms)
- [x] Reduce box-shadow complexity
- [x] Optimize logo hover animation
- [x] Improve custom cursor performance

### 2. Optimize Service Cards (services.css)
- [x] Simplify service card hover transforms (remove scale, reduce translateY)
- [x] Reduce box-shadow animations
- [x] Optimize button hover effects

### 3. Optimize Form Elements (service-form.css)
- [x] Reduce backdrop-filter usage
- [x] Simplify button hover animations
- [x] Optimize focus states

### 4. Optimize Help & Support Pages (help-support.css)
- [x] Simplify content section hover effects
- [x] Optimize contact card animations
- [x] Reduce transform complexity

### 5. General Performance Improvements
- [x] Add will-change properties where needed
- [x] Use transform3d for hardware acceleration
- [x] Reduce transition durations
- [x] Optimize CSS selectors

## Performance Optimizations Applied
- ✅ Replace complex transforms with simpler ones
- ✅ Reduce box-shadow blur radius and spread
- ✅ Use opacity changes instead of heavy effects where possible
- ✅ Add hardware acceleration hints
- ✅ Optimize transition timing functions
- ✅ Remove backdrop-filter from non-essential elements
- ✅ Reduce translateY distances (from -15px to -8px, -5px to -3px, etc.)
- ✅ Simplify custom cursor animations
- ✅ Optimize service card hover effects
- ✅ Reduce box-shadow complexity across all components

## Summary of Changes Made
1. **Navigation (main.css)**: Reduced hover transforms, simplified box-shadows, optimized custom cursor
2. **Service Cards (services.css)**: Removed scale transforms, reduced translateY distances, added will-change property
3. **Buttons (home.css)**: Simplified hover effects, reduced shadow intensity
4. **Forms (service-form.css)**: Removed backdrop-filter, simplified focus states and button animations
5. **Help Pages (help-support.css)**: Reduced all hover transform distances and shadow complexity

## Expected Performance Improvements
- Reduced GPU usage from complex transforms
- Faster hover animations with shorter distances
- Less intensive box-shadow calculations
- Improved mobile performance with optimized animations
- Better frame rates during interactions
